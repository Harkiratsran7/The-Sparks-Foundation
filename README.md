# The-Sparks-Foundation

This will contain all the projects which I have completed under the Internship Program of The Sparks Foundation.

Following are the Project Titles and Brief about the same :

  1> Prediction using Supervised ML : Here we have to Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours by analysing the given Data Set :                http://bit.ly/w-data
  
  2> Prediction using Unsupervised ML : Here From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we have to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
  
  3> Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm : For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we have to create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it
     graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
